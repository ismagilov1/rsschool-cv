## About me

Graduated from the University of MIIGAIK (Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography). I worked as a surveyor in the city of Mytishchi and built an overpass. I realized that I don't want to connect my life with work in construction. I have the desire and opportunity to learn frontend developing.
